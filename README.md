# Website-Blocker-for-WIndows
It may sound silly but the motive of making this application was to prevent myself from spending hours on youtube, social media and other websites. To my shock, it even went kinda viral among my classmates. This GUI based website blocking application was built using Python3 and it's various libraries such as Tkinter, File Handling, Os, Threading, DateTime, etc. Using this application a website can either be blocked permanently or for a specific period of time. Although, this was built for Windows, with very minor modifications in directory paths this app can work with Linux and Mac OS as well.
